# HSI Survey Analysis Tool
The HSI Survey Analysis Tool is designed to simplify the process of analyzing Human Systems Integration (HSI) surveys. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for selecting surveys, inputting data, and generating actionable results. Whether you're working with manual data entry or importing from .csv or .xlsx files, this tool streamlines the process and ensures accurate, relevant outputs tailored to your specific survey.

## Features
- Survey Selection: Choose from a variety of pre-configured HSI surveys to match your data collection needs.
- Flexible Data Input:
  - Enter data manually through the interface for small datasets.
  - Import larger datasets directly using .csv or .xlsx files.
- Automated Analysis: The tool processes your data and generates relevant outputs for the selected survey.
- Customizable Outputs: Results are tailored to the survey type, ensuring that the insights you receive are aligned with the intended analysis goals.
- User-Friendly Workflow: Designed with simplicity in mind, this tool reduces the time and effort needed for survey analysis.

## How It Works
1. Select a Survey: Begin by choosing the survey you want to analyze from the available options in the tool.
2. Input Your Data:
- Manual Input: Use the built-in form to add your survey data line by line.
- File Upload: Upload your data as a .csv or .xlsx file for bulk processing.
3. Generate Outputs: Once the data is input, the tool automatically processes it and provides the following:
- Key metrics and insights relevant to the survey.
- Visualizations (e.g., graphs, tables) if applicable.
- A summary of results to support decision-making.
4. Export Results (Optional):
- Save the processed results as a report for sharing or documentation purposes.

## Usage Examples
- Example 1: Manual Input
  - Select the desired survey type from the dropdown menu.
  - Enter responses to survey questions directly into the tool’s interface.
  - Click “Analyze” to generate results.
    
- Example 2: File Upload
  - Select the survey type and upload a .csv file containing survey responses.
  - The tool will process the data and display the relevant outputs.
 
## Outputs: The outputs generated by the tool depend on the survey type and may include:
- Summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
- Graphical representations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, histograms).
- Survey-specific recommendations or scores.
  
## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional survey formats.
- Advanced data visualization options.
- Integration with external databases for automated data import/export.
